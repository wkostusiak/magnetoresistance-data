<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a set of reusable functions which my colleague @paulinapralina is using for management of magnetoresistance measurements. 

Magnetic field [Oe] is measured at certain angles (discrete values). Two experiments are performed for each angle:
- constant magnetic field with fast temperature change in a broad range, eg. 2-100 K;
- alternating magnetic field (measured for different temperatures whose value is almost constant).
The latter experiment can be splitted into two parts: in negative or positive magnetic field.

Since aforementioned measurements are saved in a single, unordered and long .dat file, the main goal of this project is to 
automate their organization and separation.  



### Built With

* Python 3.10 
* Pandas 1.5.3



### To be done:

* plot generation
* turning code into .exe file/script
* adding simple GUI
